# The jungle must be too overgrown and difficult to navigate in vehicles or access from the air; the Elves
# expedition traditionally goes on foot. As your boats approach land, the Elves begin taking inventory of their 
# supplies. One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of Calories each Elf is carrying (your puzzle input).

# The Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc. 
# that they've brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous 
# Elf's inventory (if any) by a blank line.

# In case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: 
# they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories.
# Find the Elf carrying the most Calories. How many total Calories is that Elf carrying?

# --- Part Two ---
# By the time you calculate the answer to the Elves' question, they've already realized that the Elf carrying the most Calories of food might eventually run out of snacks.

# To avoid this unacceptable situation, the Elves would instead like to know the total Calories carried by the top three Elves carrying the most Calories.
# That way, even if one of those Elves runs out of snacks, they still have two backups.
# Find the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. How many Calories are those Elves carrying in total?
